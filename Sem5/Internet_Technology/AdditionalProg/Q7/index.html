    <div class="container-sm border">
        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The English word mango (plural "mangoes" or "mangos") originated in the 16th century from the Portuguese
            word, manga, from the Malay mangga,
            and ultimately from the Tamil man ("mango tree") + kay ("fruit").The scientific name, Mangifera indica,
            refers to a plant bearing mangoes in India.

        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>A raw mango is 84% water, 15% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat (table). The energy value per
            100 g (3.5 oz) serving of a raw mango is 250 kJ (60 calories). Fresh mango
            contains only vitamin C and folate in significant amounts of the Daily Value as 44% and 11%, respectively .

    <div class="container-lg mt-3 border">
        <h2>Cultivation</h2>
        <p>The mango is now cultivated in most frost-free tropical and warmer subtropical climates. It is cultivated
            extensively in South Asia, Southeast Asia, East and West Africa, the tropical and subtropical Americas, and
            the Caribbean.Mangoes are also grown in Andalusia, Spain (mainly in Málaga province),
            as its coastal subtropical climate is one of the few places in mainland Europe that permits the growth of
            tropical plants and fruit trees. The Canary Islands are another notable Spanish producer of the fruit. Other
            minor cultivators
            include North America (in South Florida and the California Coachella Valley), Hawai'i, and Australia</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container-xl mt-3 border">
        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>In 2020, world production of mangoes (report includes mangosteens and guavas) was 55 million tonnes, led by
            India with 45% of the total (table).[24] Almost half of the world's mangoes are cultivated in India alone,
            with the second-largest source being Indonesia.
            Although India is the largest producer of mangoes, it accounts for less than 1% of the international mango
            trade; India consumes most of its own production.</p>
